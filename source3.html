                THE Department of Health (DoH) is considering a transition from the current alert level systems against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) to a "new normal".
                <br>
                <br>
                In a Manila Times business forum on Tuesday entitled "A Good Jab for Philippine Health Care", Health Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire emphasized and scrutinized the present Covid-19 situation and said that based on the latest statistics, vaccines show high efficacy rate resulting in a lower risk of mutation.
                <br>
                <br>
                "We reiterate that vaccines are safe and effective in reducing the risk of being hospitalized and dying from Covid 19," she said.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Vaccination is still the key priority in order to attain a safe environment for everyone", Vergeire said.
                <br>
                <br>
                She ensured that vaccines are efficient in battling and protecting the individuals, especially those who are immunocompromised.
                <br>
                <br>
                "The goal of our vaccination is to protect everyone most especially the vulnerable and in achieving this we should encourage all eligible to get vaccinated," she added.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Health department will also impose a new approach upon transitioning into a "new normal", Vergeire said but added that vaccination, and safety seals on business establishments are key towards achieving this.
                <br>
                <br>
                "The DoH is continuously working on its policies and in partnership with the DILG (Department of the Interior and Local Government) assists local governments in their roll-out. Safety seals are the assurance that PDITR ((Prevent, Detect, Isolate, Treat and Reintegrate) and minimum public health standards are adhered [to] and are in place. The more establishments provided with safety seals, the more confident we are to say that these places are safe for the community," Vergeire said during the forum.
                <br>
                <br>
                The country is slowly easing restrictions, allowing people and the economy to bounce back after a long battle against the pandemic.
                <br>
                <br>
                Meanwhile, Vergeire still urges the Filipinos to get their jabs.
                <br>
                <br>
                "Please get your booster doses when you are already eligible to get it".
