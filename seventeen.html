                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em> For a four-page newsletter in Media and Information Literacy</em></p>

                            <br>As replacement for the accustomed community quarantines, the alert level system has been the catalyst for Filipinos to have confusing thoughts and misleading beliefs on which guidelines are implemented.<br>
                            <br>
            Since before the COVID-19 pandemic happened, various cases involving incomprehensible rules were already threatening our basic human rights. There have been articles in the 1987 Philippine Constitution that speak of punishment through poor phrasing, which, in turn, leaves the interpretation to individuals who can manipulate these seemingly capable words to their favor. For instance, people who committed so-called “unjust vexations” could actually be punished with either a hefty fine or imprisonment wherein the definition for the actual crime is ambiguous; to put it simply, this offense could range from minor annoyances up to a disturbing karaoke party late at night. How these words are constructed can inflict either harm or goodwill to the individuals subjected to it. In this case, there is no need for the Inter-Agency Task Force to modify the names and make the quarantine restrictions more complicated than it actually is.<br>
            <br>
            As campaigned by President Rodrigo Duterte, change is coming. However, how does these changes benefit us if all we experience are constant, unrelenting modifications that trigger our fear of the future? The COVID-19 pandemic came off as a shock that transformed the world we are used to into something that is far stranger than we have ever encountered. More importantly, the newly developed alert level system does not actually help us adjust at all; in fact, its implementation suggests that the government already expects a degree of herd immunity developing among us, even though they have barely started the vaccination process. Overestimating our adaptability to environmental changes puts everyone in a tight spot. If worse comes to worst, what good will these brief moments of exemptions be?<br>
            <br>
            All of us long for the day we could all rip the masks off our faces and breathe the air like how we were before the pandemic happened. This hope is not meant to be tainted with hasty implementations of an alert level system that confuses and distorts the way we adjust in accordance to our surroundings. For this reason, the Inter-Agency Task Force does not have to complicate matters and make the guidelines more incomprehensible than ever. Easing quarantine restrictions comes with higher risks in contracting the disease. As we try to adapt and survive against the unpredictable, we should never forget that the virus is also trying to live with us as its enemies. With the rise of the present-day alert level system, the changes we are used to are slowly becoming lax. When our invisible adversary hits us where it hurts the most, who knows what will happen if we remain adamant on the questionable new names of quarantine.<br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                            <br>With seats of power on the verge of replacement and legal immunity drawing to a close, Rodrigo Duterte must take responsibility for all the innocent lives damaged by his infamous war on drugs, and that is, by adhering to the International Criminal Court’s investigation on his bloody six-year term as President of the Philippines. <br>
                            <br>A campaign built upon various threats, disrespectful remarks, and intimidating statements against criminals enabled Rodrigo Duterte to win the 2016 Presidential elections. He captured the hearts of the poor who were afflicted with countless decisions involving illegal measures to escape the difficulties of poverty. Unexpectedly, Duterte responded to these malice through a shoot-to-kill order for illegal drug suspects. With additional power over his commandeered police force, the line between prosecution and execution blurred against the poor. Duterte’s words disregarded the presumption of their innocence. <br>
                            <br>Filed by the International Criminal Court (ICC), cases against Duterte caught up with him. When cooperation is expected, Duterte fired back statements that ICC representatives will be denied entry to the country amid an authority to investigate since they no longer have any jurisdiction when the Philippines left the said organization in March 2019. To the public, he gave out remarks on how he could run for vice president over and over again to maintain a status of absolute immunity over these cases. With words that are as fickle as the wind, Duterte used his current position to say no against the tribunal and it is not illegal to do so. <br>
                            <br>In contrast to the Philippine President’s claim, the International Criminal Court (ICC) did not abuse their authority in the implementation of their full-blown investigation on his war on drugs. They replied that this case will involve facts that happened before the country withdrew from the organization, starting from November 2011. Accordingly, Duterte’s insistence on running for vice president to gain legal immunity was refuted as he recently proclaimed his resignation to politics. If he is as guilty as the ICC says, his prosecution will finally silence the cries of the victims of his reign, regaining human rights infringed by his word. <br>
                            <br>With or without power, President Rodrigo Duterte must remain cooperative in proving that he is not guilty in the midst of his term’s extrajudicial killings. The second he is replaced as the highest authority in the country, no legal implications and hasty words will make him escape the fate of being the catalyst of countless Filipinos killed from his method on the Philippines’ war on drugs. Duterte should focus on fighting the cases against him head-on without heading to the hills. In times where his words become power, President Duterte must make sure that the responsibility coming with it is in accordance with his actions, even as a private citizen in his beloved country. <br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                            <br>With his past as Rodrigo Duterte’s Davao Death Squad (DDS) hitman and accessory to its crimes, Arturo Lascañas is both a witness and a criminal; that being said, the International Criminal Court’s decision to grant him limited immunity for his self-inflicting confessions is justice in its own way.<br>
                            <br>Revealing the truth after years of cover-ups and evasion is hard enough but securing a confession can make or break a case, even if it comes from the mouth of the bad guy himself. As an individual, Arturo Lascañas can be suspected with untold criminal cases and involvement with the Davao Death Squad. He declared that this group followed kill orders from Rodrigo Duterte, former Mayor of Davao City and current President of the Philippines. In spite of how this confession affects the case, Lascañas’ accusations does not mean that he is exempted from the crimes he committed himself. The limited immunity given to him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prevents him from self-incriminating himself but, as International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) senior expert Ruben Carranza said, Arturo Lascañas’ immunity is only for the prosecution for the ICC’s investigation of Duterte’s drug war and the alleged DDS.<br>
                            <br>Without the limited immunity deal between ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) and him, Lascañas’ words could be lost forever, especially when his life is as dangerous as the circumstances he confessed to. The possibility of him being prosecuted by his country housing the squad he betrayed heightens. With Senate investigations terminated by his want to testify, the only option Arturo Lascañas has is to protect himself through the international court. According to ICTJ lawyer Carranza, Lascañas’ words are the key in determining the decision on who will be charged for these crimes and finally solving the cases involving Duterte and his Davao Death Squad. All Filipinos need to know the truth behind this intricate web of accusations so the country should also cut this whistleblower some slack and proceed to protect him until justice reigns all. <br>
                            <br>As a former assassin and a vital witness, Arturo Lascañas’ limited immunity from his confession is the best way to bring justice to Filipino lives affected by Duterte's drug war and the Davao Death Squad’s presence. The Philippines must also help this man shed light to the words he spoke of and cooperate with the International Criminal Court. Everyone deserves to know what really happened in these past few years, and with the witness-assin Arturo Lascañas’ protection, the truth may prevail after all. <br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                            <br>When mere speculations can convict countless Filipinos accused of illegal drug crimes, the approval of House Bill No. 7814 drives fear into the hearts of the innocent, replacing their trust with dread as they fear assumptions that can sentence them as guilty— even if they are innocent.<br>
                            <br>As a fiercer way to implement the Republic Act No. 9165, also known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, HB 7814 gives more power to law enforcement agents. A provision states how a person is first presumed to be guilty with drug-related crimes, may it be abetting an escape or possessing importation receipts, before he could prove it otherwise. When this bill becomes law, the usual ‘innocent until proven guilty’ will be reversed when it comes to accusations involving illegal drugs. As understood by Jesus Suntay, House committee on human rights chair, his vote in favor of HB 7814  will be convicting the accused through speculations, which is an act he does not approve of. Proper investigations on drug-related suspects could be overlooked and hasty assumptions might prevail. Those who are framed for their involvement could have their lives stuck on imprisonment when they are actually blameless.<br>
                            <br>	In another perspective, the terror House Bill No. 7814 brings is effective against sought-after drug personalities who remained unscathed because of the tame nature of RA 9165. According to Robert Ace Barbers, House committee on dangerous drugs chair, law enforcers armed with legal presumptions will have the chance to put the evasive accused over the same pedestal as the suspected drug criminals. Regardless, everyone will be overpowered by this bill when the time comes. When the line between ifs and innocence becomes blurry because of HB 7814, must the country wait for spilled blood before realizing that turning this bill into law is as bad as it gets?<br>
                            <br>	The harsh nature of a law might be present but at the end of the day, it is still the law. Unfortunately, time is running out before House Bill No. 7814 amends RA 9165, making those involved with drugs guilty before they are innocent. When hasty conclusions are at bay, Philippine prisons could be filled with scapegoats and framed individuals. With this questionable bill, who knows how many civilian lives could be jeopardized in the hands of law. <br>

                            <br>Smiling faces turn into frowns as typhoon-affected Filipinos claim: how long should they be resilient when disasters come? Sure enough, the famed bayanihan can help them live for so but after all this time, the government should be embarrassed about their inaction towards their suffering subjects. Nobody is at fault for the harsh typhoons that wrecked homes and livelihoods but the aftermath must be handled by those with power. These disasters fuel distrust among the public to their leader more than the independence they are expected of.<br>
                            <br>As Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte lamented that the budget is “immensely depleted,” he still promised a Php 10 billion allocation. While Filipinos drown and despair, he spoke of an amount that may or may not reach the affected in time. The implications of his words are endless; is he saying that bayanihan must help first before the government’s response? Duterte is basically giving the lives of his people into their own hands. He could have thought of something different to make sure that Filipinos could have had their lives easier. His inaction is distressing; it should be easier for him to express his compassion as having the highest position of power. <br>
                            <br>The self-reliance of Filipinos may be a good thing but after everything that has happened, what if this empathy wanes? It may be the citizens’ responsibility to look after each other but with the government who possesses the most resources and the highest authority, it must make enough laws to fuel hope for tomorrow even after disasters. In all of the years the Philippines stood against its fight against the weather, the President must focus on regaining the public’s trust through relief operations and sustainable solutions. If he is willing to take action, countless organizations are willing to pair up with him. Bayanihan involves everyone, and with more power, the greater amount of help is given to the affected.<br>
                            <br>When disasters end, distrust soon arrives. How this country’s politicians become indifferent to its citizens does not show an inkling on what a public-serving government should be. With everybody familiar with the progressing disasters that arrive, the President and other governmental organizations should have plans regarding the safety of the society. When lives are being lost and expectance becomes acceptance, will power even matter for the people?<br>

                            <br>Like that obstinate friend dragging us to that God-forsaken roller-coaster ride, Ferdinand “Bong Bong” Marcos, Jr. is leading the country through plastic promises of unity and reformation; meanwhile, the road ahead of us remains unmapped.<br>
                            <br>We are all familiar with how political campaigning works: catchy jingles, candidate-defining colors, and soundbites presenting their agenda for the next few years. Accordingly, every presidential candidate has their own method of winning our hearts but their actions all answer one question: If elected as the President of the Philippines, what can you do for the Filipinos? Bong Bong Marcos answers, guess what? Unity! As stated in an article from Rappler, his Uniteam (with running mate Sara Duterte) said cooperation is the key for this “new society” he’s planning to lead us into. He’s campaigning for change when in reality, this Junior is using the dead dictator’s legacy to claim more votes! All the media knows about him is how he stubbornly revives the compromised image of Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.. If he sits in the highest position of the country, will he conjure the ghost of his father to seek advice? Marcos, Jr. is not his father; he neither has his achievements nor his eloquence. Why should the public vote for a child borrowing the face of his father?
                            <br>
                            <br>Yes, he is not Marcos, Sr. but at the same time, he is. Bong Bong can just make the Philippines better, like the first half of his father’s reign, and prevent the oppressive Martial Law from happening again. Easy, right? No! In comparison to his Uniteam, other presidential candidates have more detailed plans expressed through televised debates and clear-as-day campaigns. His vague agenda leads the country into a world of unknown and with our worsening state, how does he plan to drag us away from hell with only “unity” in mind?<br>
                            <br>Rome wasn’t built in a day, and surely, their plans to build it weren’t just a big unity word scribbled across a page. Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. should try elaborating what his campaign is all about. Is it a farce to fool Filipinos that we’re looking at his impressive but oppressive father? Is the entirety of his plan focused on winning the hearts of everyone while the country’s economy falls? Will his win give us a breath of fresh air and think, this son is finally paying for his father’s sins?<br>
                            <br>In the 2022 Presidential elections, Bong Bong Marcos may carry the image of his father but no matter how related they are, he will not be as good as him. Junior’s credentials, tact, and presence is a shadow to what Marcos supporters expect him to be. This roller-coaster ride is not what the Philippines currently needs. Inside a dark cave with BBM claiming light, the public must not trust him because we know he cannot make one.<br>

                            <br> Equipped with a 100% vaccination shield, are students’ lives worth enough for their pursuit of education?<br>
                            <br>
                            In a sea of various learning methods, we are all adrift with sails damaged by the limits
                            given by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sailors like us are eyeing the port to better education: how can
                            we strive for more knowledge if we do not know what method suits us best? Of course, the
                            government’s plan to supply us with tablets, SIM cards and second-hand laptops made it easier
                            for us students to access knowledge stopped by distance. With the usual face-to-face classes
                            prohibited, social interaction is limited and lingering questions remained unaddressed.
                            However, these possibilities were ignored by Bulacan who stubbornly resumed classes
                            even when the Philippines’ current state does not prove the pandemic’s end.<br>
                            <br>
                            As soon as we welcomed January 2022 with fireworks, COVID-19 cases also reached the
                            skies. When both students and teachers, even in the midst of their homes, were plagued by the
                            disease, the Department of Education announced a sudden, academic break. Around this
                            moment, fully-vaccinated Bulakenyos were already nearing 97% of the eligible population.
                            According to an article by Inquirer, the province was not exempted from this spike in cases, which
                            reached 393 active cases as of January 2. Are we underestimating COVID-19 for the sake of us
                            being vaccinated? Being inoculated with the vaccine does not mean that everyone is literally
                            invincible against the said virus. Yes, the severity of the disease is lessened. Most vaccination
                            efficacies are above 90% but are we willing to sacrifice others, especially students, whose lives
                            are hanging on this percentage? When education remains accessible in the safety of their homes,
                            why would they need to go further and get out of their safe zone? <br>
                            <br>
                            All of us long for the day we could all rip the masks off our faces and laugh with our
                            classmates and teachers like how we were before the pandemic happened. This hope is not
                            meant to be tainted with a hasty implementation of a face-to-face class just because everyone is
                            already protected. Easing restrictions comes with higher risks in contracting the disease.
                            Everyone must wait; there will come a time when this pandemic will turn endemic.<br>
                            <br>
                            As we try to adapt and survive against the unpredictable, we should never forget that the
                            virus is also trying to live with us as its enemies. With the rise of several distance learning
                            methods, the changes we are used to will soon be the usual. When our invisible adversary hits
                            us where it hurts the most, who knows what will happen if we remain blinded on the failure face-
                            to-face classes might bring.<br>

      <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em> Like how functional groups are to an organic compound, what characteristics you may have which is unique to other and can help you as an individual? </em></p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
      <br> Look around! <br>
      <br>
      Everybody looks the same⁠— with their human appearance and characteristics, there is no doubt that the Homo sapiens is as distinct as it gets. Even with the presence of physical and psychological disabilities, there is no doubt that the person next to me is just as human as I am. There are times when I wonder, “Since everyone knows how each of us is unique, what differentiates me from the rest of humanity?” Will it be the unreplicable composition of my DNA? Is it the way I perceive the world in the present? Maybe uniqueness is defined by how one defines their soul while using their body as a medium of expression. What is it that makes me who I am despite being the same with the rest of humanity? <br>
      <br>
      Me being a unique human being seems like a bad thing; if I were in an anime, I could be regarded as the typical side character having this aloof aura and timid personality, wearing glasses like my life depends on it and making it seem like I am hiding myself from everyone around me. In the real world, I actually describe myself as someone who does not fit well with others. I call this characteristic nonconformity. This word is loads better than calling myself indifferent and estranged to others. Being nonconforming comforts me; it is a state where I know myself that I am different and I do not really care if I am one. This trait of mine puts me in a position where I am able to do anything I want while slightly disregarding the road normalcy laid in front of me. I believe that being nonconforming means that nothing can form me. I am my own shape in a world full of square pegs and it helps me by giving me strength whenever I feel like I am getting lost in the waves of socially accepted standards.
      <br>
      <br>
      Losing myself in a sea of ordinariness does not mean that I am not as unique as I think I am. In a way, I perceive myself as an individual whose state of nonconformity and multipotentiality does not negate how I am as normal as everyone else. All of us are entitled to feeling unique while grouping ourselves according to our similarities. Humans are so lucky; they have the commonly uncommon me!<br>

  <br>Normalcy defined our world; well, not until the COVID-19 happened. Three years after, our nation is still stuck within its comfort zone, believing that the reopening of our economy meant coronavirus resurgence. However, everyone already has the scar symbolizing these changes that we are now used to. With both knowledge and bravery, we are more than prepared to face the new normal.
<br> <br>
Starting with Metro Manila, the government should start downgrading the alert levels assigned to each province when they fulfill certain conditions. Like what a Rappler article concluded, the average daily attack rate and the reproduction number of the virus of the region already fulfilled the World Health Organization’s standards: a country with less than 5% positivity rate can start reopening its economy. As survivors of the pandemic, we are used to the virus preventive measures and the corresponding inoculation process. With our knowledge as shield and the COVID-19 vaccine as our spear, what are we afraid of?<br> <br>
Still, the lingering anxieties of our mind are shouting: the COVID-19 pandemic has not turned into an endemic; therefore, it is better to retreat than advance against our invisible enemy. What is there to fear when everybody knows how to keep themselves safe from the virus? For the past three years, we have been bombarded with information on what to do and how to survive against the disease. With this knowledge, we are already facing our fear of dying! How we have studied the coronavirus and vaccinated ourself against it are indications that we are embracing how this change could affect our future. Why must we stop at that?<br> <br>
When adversity comes, bravery must prevail before cowardice. With our modern technologies and intelligent data analysts, the Philippines is more than prepared to welcome the new society defined by the COVID-19 pandemic. Living in the new normal is not an easy task, per se, since both the rewards and the risks are too high. Accordingly, our government already anticipated and calculated what choices must be chosen. Don’t forget, the ABCs of new normal are as easy as it gets! <br>

                <br>In prolonging the war between Ukraine, Russia is indirectly killing itself, starting from essential diplomatic roles up to the lives of the very citizens that it treasures. <br>
                <br>
With a military multinational alliance recruiting countries all around its border, Russia opted to act on its anxiety and greed: it claimed that NATO’s expansion through Ukraine is unacceptable and distressed that Ukrainians are the ones acting against them, which they determined to be a plausible reason for war. As stated by the ABS-CBN News Channel, Russia’s invasion is centered around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and with its end unforeseen, the war will be more harmful to their forces than beneficial. Using dirty tactics such as misinformation and propaganda will not make their situation better than ever.<br>
<br>
While Russia pushes through Ukraine’s defense, direct consequences hit the rest of its stubbornness to win the war. As stated by Richard Mills, United States deputy ambassador to UN, 12 Russian diplomats were expelled since they were taking part in activities not related to their current position that concerned their national security. Even the neutral Switzerland joins the EU-imposed sanctions to Russia. Major corporations like Shell, Aercap, Microsoft and Disney terminated some of their business involvements with the country. Leading sports coordinators agreed in banning Russian athletes in international events. As the Russian Ruble fell, the country’s decision to increase their interest rate to 20% troubled its citizens in doing so. These disadvantages are not worth it for their pursuit of power!<br>
<br>
While Russia faced indirect attacks coming from everywhere, Ukraine grasped on the receiving end of the world’s affection. Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. reached out to the ministers of the neighboring countries of Ukraine to receive Filipinos evacuating from Ukraine, even if they have no visa. The generosity of foreign individuals all around the world are helping the Ukrainians flee the bloodbath coming from their home country. What is Russia aiming for with all of the lives spilled from their greed?<br>
<br>
Russia’s choice to go to war is a decision that they will no longer have the chance to reverse. Ukraine’s measures to save itself and the world’s response on their plight is deserving on what it seems to be a prideful invasion. When the end is not in sight, Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine has bitten them back. It is up to them if they should let go or further fall back into the trap they have set for themselves.

                                <br>Money makes the world go round—and sadly, the Philippines Is not an exception. From international financial investments up to government budget allocations, every aspect of our country is built upon how our President manages to find the correct balance between what to pay for and how to earn more. With the upcoming Presidential elections involving monetary risks greater than ever, the candidates should be more transparent than ever. Our economy is on a tightrope! Are they ready to flaunt their stable footing?<br>
                                <br>
                We are all too familiar with the ups and downs of the Philippine’s finances. First, Martial Law survivors experienced the unexpected plunge of the peso—from Php 4 down to Php 21 in exchange to 1 US dollar. Next, ex-President Estrada was ousted due to his economic plunder; we all knew how his popularity was backed by his presence as a movie star, not on his financial prowess. For centuries of living as proud Filipinos, we are still voting for the wrong candidates. Being hooked by their charisma, ancestry, and awards in fields unrelated to politics is unbecoming. When will we ever learn? Luckily, there is still time.<br>
                <br>
                Our economic stability has been shaken up by the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic and how we will survive this disaster is in our own hands: our vote! As UP Political Science professor  Herman Kraft said, the balance between government programs and pandemic response is crucial in opening our wealth. Our financial status is dependent upon who sits in the highest position of power, the President. Through his expertise, Kraft enumerated every Presidentiables’ potential, with emphasis on those who expressed commendable leadership and problem-solving skills. Requesting transparency over these candidates’ financial status, especially their SALN, has never been more important than ever!<br>
                <br>
                	With democracy in mind and money in sight, everyone has the right to know more about the future President of the Philippines. By starting out with the evidences that prove how flawless each candidate handles their finances, we will know if they could finally go on stage and walk above the tightrope—that is, our wealth in shambles. Through our inked index finger, we can bring back the economy up to the skies!<br>

With the release of the newly implemented National ID scheme, Filipinos will be able to prove their identity and age solely through this government-issued card. Among the usual Social Security System and professional license identification cards, even driver's licenses and passports, that swamp up our wallets, we will be able to sail smoothly against the confusing transactions other IDs might bring, with boosted productivity in hand.<br><br>
According to a government agency, a National ID card can only be issued to those above 18 years old, which is our nation's determined legal age, so it is perfect for everyone who recently celebrated their legality. With the existence of this ID, they do not have to mingle with other people in obtaining another government-issued identifications. Filipinos in both middle to low classes do not have to apply for driver's licenses or passports just to have some sort of card identifying their identity. The number of valid IDs we can obtain from various state departments is countless but with the power of a National ID, we can skip all of those endless lines and get one, if all we need is a valid card to define us.<br><br>
By going through a single long process that is worth it for our time and effort, the rest of us can easily prove if we are definitely of age. Identifying individuals entering adult-only bars or even the ongoing vaccination process will be easier with the power of the National ID. It will also makes it easier for these recent adults to enjoy the benefits experiencing legality. For example, one who wants to purchase alcohol in a wine section of a supermarket could do so by simply pulling out his/her National ID card. With the irregularities behind the average Filipino's height and their age, everyone can affirm the other that they are, in fact, of legal age.
Contrastingly, using this single ID card for various official transactions can turn into a major security breach especially if someone lost his or her own. Even though the Inquirer reports that Duterte affirms how the National ID's existence is enough for both government and private transactions, we still should not disregard the value of our other identification cards. If, in the near future, the counter will solely request for a National ID, the existence of the driver's license or passports for identification will turn obsolete; what if the owner forgets or loses this specific ID? Relying on National IDs is a great move but this must not inhibit us, or the government, from denying other identification methods.<br><br>
The amount of productivity National IDs can bring determines how it is enough for us to conduct any kind of legal transaction through it. Still, we must forget about skimming through countless of other identifying documents and embrace the simplicity of a single government ID that defines who you are on the spot. With our other IDs as the Plan B, the government must not disregard their existence just because they only see the benefits the National ID brings. It is enough, but it must not be alone!
