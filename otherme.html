            <div class="mid" id="two" style="display: none;">
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em>I was in a gathering with my family and another in one of the high-rise buildings in the place. When tomorrow came, we were interrogated by people who tried to find out why a kid's mangled body was found floors below, on the ground.</em></p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br> We were in my father's company, high up in the floors, celebrating some important occasion, like Christmas maybe?, but I don't recall seeing those trees and fancy lights. Anyway, few minutes after I finished roaming around the room, there was this another family who we welcomed like we knew of them. I don't remember who they were exactly but they were a couple with their child, a boy about seven to ten years old.
                After doing all the typical things that happens in a celebration, may it be drinking alcohol, eating fancy delicacies, and bonding with each other, my father went to my bedroom space's window and stared at the night; all of the adjacent buildings dimmed out as if they were asleep. It was one of his hobbies to observe how quiet everything is even in the midst of our room's blinding white lights. That day was just as normal as any day it can be. <br>
                <br> Well, except for the fact that the kid brought a typical kitchen knife and rushed towards him like he was about to stab his thigh. Does anyone remember the existence of a femoral artery? I swear, he was clearly aiming for it but I think he wouldn't have the guts to thrust that weapon with enough murderous intent. Oh well, you know what, that boy's not lucky to have me watching that scene unfold. <br>
                <br> I casually walked to my father's side and stabbed that child on his back, as if I was just reaching out to pull the plug of some appliance. He grabbed my father's leg; in a few seconds, he was dead. I don't know how it happens next but I remember being scolded about why did I need to kill him when I can just get the knife and let him go away from the room. We decided that we should just throw him outside the window (I remember thinking about how much energy should I spend if I wanted his body to fall in front of another building) so while my father carried his upper body, I pushed the boy over the edge. I remember hearing a more sooner splat that indicated how the kid fell. I don't know what happens to the parents or the blood that messed up the room. I don't even know if I slept soundly that night. <br>
                <br> The second scene unfolds in a wider room full of dark red curtains and corporate furniture. I don't remember knowing anyone but a few people were present, waiting, like me. There was this also this space that covered half the room and it was draped with the same curtains but was closed off like it was some sort of interogation site. I remember me realizing that they were determining what the hell happened to that dead boy and how he ended up smashing his skull with a knife in his hand. I sat still for  few minutes and when it was my time to be interviewed, I saw my sister leaving that room and meeting up with our mother like it was the most normal thing to do. <br>
                <br> The first thought I had was seeing how that interrogrator looked like one of my teachers, Roxanne. All the room had was a black table with chairs facing each other. She was also taking down notes and observing the way I carry myself but after a few minutes, she was still going nowhere. My patience ran out and it seems like I initiated the conversation but I don't remember what it was all about. I think I wasted enough time writing this dream so much I forgot that detail. <br>
                <br> She did not manage to ask me any questions of my involvement, just some few disses about how I'm taking in charge of the conversation when in fact, she was the investigator. I think I spoke of too many things that may regard me as some sufferer of schizophrenia. At the end, I remember telling her my thoughts on how dreams can be confused with reality (This scene was insane; I thought I was being called out as the dreamer of that dream and it made me so confused about my current reality: Am I the me who killed that boy or am I the one who's dreaming that dream?) and it seemed like I implied how I could occasionally dissociate with my present so the result of my actions with that child's death conflicted with my belief on what's real and what isn't. All in all, she did not really mind me and dismissed me as if I was one of the rambling, unsuspected people who's actually guilty of the crime. To be noted, though, I did not confess. When I left the room, I brushed past my father who's next and I thought that I could stay this way for a while, feigning ignorance on the truth behind what happened that night and thinking about how it was really a dream or some alternate version of me as a murderer.

                <p style="font-size: 12px;font-family: Overpass, sans-serif;"><em>Please be reminded that this is a freaking dream and I don't even know why I dreamt of this. This was so real I was glad I freaking woke up. I felt like I was me in a different world and I actually forgot how I was supposed to be a teenager living in this seemingly normal world. Some scenes that I remember happening all faded away since I took too long in writing this. Did you realize how my dream freaking broke the fourth wall? or is it just me overthinking about it?</em></p><small style="font-family: Overpass, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;"><br></small>

            <br> Nothing big. It was 7:28 AM and I was supposed to submit an article at 7:30 AM. I never got the chance to add in my title and I know I've done a shitty job in the text.
