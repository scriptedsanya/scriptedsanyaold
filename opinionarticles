                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"> Press and Proclamations: Who's More Threatened by Self-Expression?</p>
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.rappler.com/moveph/with-anti-terror-law-red-tagged-campus-press-struggle-report-coronavirus-pandemic">Red-tagging: a threat to press freedom and democracy</a></em></p>

                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>Mediums of communication, may it be the air, a text message, or a Tweet flung across the Internet for the world to see, are readily available and easily obtainable by average Filipinos, but that doesn't mean that they're ready to go all out and shout, "I hate my neighbor's noisy dog; I wish he would just die," right? <br>
                <br> The 1987 Constitution, Article III, Section 4 announces that "no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or the press..." Since the law recognizes everyone, whether you, your friends, the creepy guy at the terminal, or the terrorists living here, it's pretty evident that it implies how we can deliver ourselves effortlessly since nothing cannot stop us from prohibiting it.<br>
                <br> Of course, a criticized example of this situation is the sinister Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020. Neri Colmenares, Human Rights Lawyer, speaks on how this proclamation threatens the freedom of expression since it indicates how it could punish people who instigate others in executing terrorism "by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, banners or other representations tending to the same end." Contradictingly, a study led by Martin Obschonka, an associate professor at the Queensland University of Technology, discovered how people's characteristics could be formulated through digital self-expression, specifically, Tweets, where vulnerabilities can be scientifically observed. Even actions like stalking our crush on Facebook to discover that he likes challenges and hating dictators make us guilty of judging their lives based on software.<br>
                <br> Behind a screen, there's no telling if a person is capable of anything. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 does not also include how investigating social media activities are seen as violations of human rights. It presents a conclusion that the Federal Bureau of Investigation can legally snoop in and out of our accounts and subjecting public posts to the possibility that it can be a threat to national security. Since there's no need to indicate opinions that may put your reputation at risk, what is there to fear? Having proclamations that prohibit the freedom of expression, particularly the Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020, save us from the dangers of too much freedom granted to us. If we can stop verbally abusing others for their sake, why don't we establish it digitally? This controversial law is proven to make the country a better place. Poland, for example, flexes the same condition as the Philippines. As stated by the International Center for Counter-Terrorism, its National Threat Level is at 0% since the establishment of its Anti-Terrorism Law compared to the Philippines' Global Terrorism Index, which also declined after President Duterte signed the said bill.
                <br>
                <br> These limits imposed on the freedom of expression are also applied to campus journalists who write their way to push their liberty. What is there to fight against if the Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020 protects ourselves from the temptations of too much freedom? Comparing it to the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, strict quarantines can be considered violations of our civil liberties; why people follow it is evident since it
                presents a physical limitation. <br>
                <br> Complementarily, a statement by Charles Friend in The Harvard Gazette brandishes how "the
                liberties of getting where you want to go are less concerning than the potential for disinformation and
                rumor-mongering." After all, even the United States of America includes laws that recognize the
                limitations of freedom of speech if it inflicts damage to the other party involved. <br>
                <br> The Ericsson Mobility Report reveals that in 2021, smartphone users in the Philippines will hit 90
                million; that's the same amount of people who have a right to express their disagreement, dangerous
                views, possible threats, and troublesome plans about the government. We might be wondering, "Does
                everything I say defines who I am today?" According to the Anti-Terror Law of 2020, it's a "Yes!" <br>

                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>Sudden changes in the Department of Education’s curriculum pursued the removal of Philippine History, leaving the masses with an impaired ability to determine the differences between the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea. This controversial territorial dispute gained the popularity it instilled in social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Since fake news circulated the Internet, and these alterations can twist the public, the issues regarding to ditching the historical background of the Philippines as a high school subject remained up for debate. Does the lack of knowledge about the Philippine History, especially when it comes to territories, affect the public’s understanding of the differences between the rightful name of the sea? Absolutely, yes!<br>
                <br> Fake news has circulated the Internet; most prominent alterations observed in popular social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. With a lack of background knowledge, most Filipinos may interchangeably use South China Sea or the West Philippine Sea as a name pertaining to a single body of water. Even the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo was recently confused about the disparities between China’s self-proclaimed territory and the Philippines’ zone. After the ABS-CBN News Channel reported this complication on YouTube, hundreds of comments ranted on how lies were being fed by the same government they voted on. Our freedom of information, even though it is still accessible, became shrouded by the order the Department of Education imposed. How important is Philippine History among elementary pupils when high school students like us can actually have the ability to change the world?<br>
                <br>We must fear how the fast-paced millennium will soon turn truth to rumors. The critical thinking we can pursue through the implementation of Philippine History in the high school curriculum will change every perspective for the better. In accordance with what High School Philippine History Movement President Jamaico D. Ignacio stated, social media encourages historical distortions and historical revisionism. Our history became vulnerable to change! What would this incident lead to? False information, manipulated facts, and changed perceptions will change the Philippines in unpredictable ways.<br>
                <br>The fiasco between the rightful name of the sea between the Philippines’ and China’s may start to worsen, especially when the Filipinos themselves remained confused on how to identify their territories versus the Chinese. As stated by the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea professor Jay Batongbacal in an ABS-CBN report, an international tribunal finalized the Philippines’ rule of the West Philippine Sea, as opposed to the fake news circulating that our nation has no right over the said territory. If this fabrication from the Internet continued to manipulate the minds of the Filipinos, we might have gone against a government who may be doing the best they can for our sake.
                <br>
                <br>Lies, lies, lies. Everything may be a lie, but if published Philippine History lecture books state otherwise, we will have a chance to prey on what is right. <br>

                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>A democratic government like the Philippines stands high and mighty because of the people that voted in favor of its excellence and integrity, but if individuality became compromised caused by one’s lack of insight of the past, Generations X and Alpha may transform for the worst.<br>
                <br>The significance of individuality came from the High School Philippine History Movement’s stance to bring back Philippine History as a high school subject that strengthens critical thinking, in contradiction to the memorization-based technique. If this trait is overlooked, the Department of Labor and Employment will encounter thousands of college graduates who lack the essential competencies. The inadequacy of lessons on the Philippine History risks this possibility, but this will not be the end of the crisis.<br>
                <br> In critical thinking, objectivity in analysis of an argument prevails. We can also gain this skill from other subjects, such as Mathematics, English, and Science, but History instigates the growth of loyalty to one’s nation. A study published also determined how self-identity and nationalism bonds, so did the Department of Health need to remove the Philippines’ past as a high school subject when it serves as the beacon that uncovers who we are? No way!<br>
                <br>The drop of critical thinkers prevails in our generation, which similarly alters the next millennium. Logical reasoning and evaluation continue to fail our expectations to the children left to reinvigorate the world. Social issues, specially poverty and homelessness, can be addressed properly if students gain continuous lessons that encourage critical thinking, which boost their self-identity. Have you encountered a fellow Filipino delighted with his individuality and embracing his nationalism? What would our majestic nation be like if Filipinos know more about their past and become critical thinkers that understand issues through a well-meaning self-identity?
                <br>
                <br> The Filipinos’ individuality connects with the Philippine democracy, and critical thinking manipulates the state of knowing oneself. The crisis highlighting the lack of this skill influences one’s self-identity that disrupts significant aspects in one’s life. Studying Philippine History as a high school student will dramatically improve their well-being, as opposed to memorization proven to heighten their stress levels. An hour of history, with open-ended questions about forgotten controversies, is better than mathematical jargons that everyone needs to learn by heart even though more of them long to be a journalist.<br>
                <br>As the saying goes, the past predicts the present, which affects the future. Will you choose to forget the Philippines’ previous experiences or encourage its reinstatement for every Filipino who longs to be critical thinkers that would fight for what is true? <br>
                <br>Prioritize the past! Let it refine you! <br>

                <br>As replacement for the accustomed community quarantines, the alert level system has been the catalyst for Filipinos to have confusing thoughts and misleading beliefs on which guidelines are implemented.<br>
                <br>
Since before the COVID-19 pandemic happened, various cases involving incomprehensible rules were already threatening our basic human rights. There have been articles in the 1987 Philippine Constitution that speak of punishment through poor phrasing, which, in turn, leaves the interpretation to individuals who can manipulate these seemingly capable words to their favor. For instance, people who committed so-called “unjust vexations” could actually be punished with either a hefty fine or imprisonment wherein the definition for the actual crime is ambiguous; to put it simply, this offense could range from minor annoyances up to a disturbing karaoke party late at night. How these words are constructed can inflict either harm or goodwill to the individuals subjected to it. In this case, there is no need for the Inter-Agency Task Force to modify the names and make the quarantine restrictions more complicated than it actually is.<br>
<br>
As campaigned by President Rodrigo Duterte, change is coming. However, how does these changes benefit us if all we experience are constant, unrelenting modifications that trigger our fear of the future? The COVID-19 pandemic came off as a shock that transformed the world we are used to into something that is far stranger than we have ever encountered. More importantly, the newly developed alert level system does not actually help us adjust at all; in fact, its implementation suggests that the government already expects a degree of herd immunity developing among us, even though they have barely started the vaccination process. Overestimating our adaptability to environmental changes puts everyone in a tight spot. If worse comes to worst, what good will these brief moments of exemptions be?<br>
<br>
All of us long for the day we could all rip the masks off our faces and breathe the air like how we were before the pandemic happened. This hope is not meant to be tainted with hasty implementations of an alert level system that confuses and distorts the way we adjust in accordance to our surroundings. For this reason, the Inter-Agency Task Force does not have to complicate matters and make the guidelines more incomprehensible than ever. Easing quarantine restrictions comes with higher risks in contracting the disease. As we try to adapt and survive against the unpredictable, we should never forget that the virus is also trying to live with us as its enemies. With the rise of the present-day alert level system, the changes we are used to are slowly becoming lax. When our invisible adversary hits us where it hurts the most, who knows what will happen if we remain adamant on the questionable new names of quarantine.<br>

                <br>With seats of power on the verge of replacement and legal immunity drawing to a close, Rodrigo Duterte must take responsibility for all the innocent lives damaged by his infamous war on drugs, and that is, by adhering to the International Criminal Court’s investigation on his bloody six-year term as President of the Philippines. <br>
                <br>A campaign built upon various threats, disrespectful remarks, and intimidating statements against criminals enabled Rodrigo Duterte to win the 2016 Presidential elections. He captured the hearts of the poor who were afflicted with countless decisions involving illegal measures to escape the difficulties of poverty. Unexpectedly, Duterte responded to these malice through a shoot-to-kill order for illegal drug suspects. With additional power over his commandeered police force, the line between prosecution and execution blurred against the poor. Duterte’s words disregarded the presumption of their innocence. <br>
                <br>Filed by the International Criminal Court (ICC), cases against Duterte caught up with him. When cooperation is expected, Duterte fired back statements that ICC representatives will be denied entry to the country amid an authority to investigate since they no longer have any jurisdiction when the Philippines left the said organization in March 2019. To the public, he gave out remarks on how he could run for vice president over and over again to maintain a status of absolute immunity over these cases. With words that are as fickle as the wind, Duterte used his current position to say no against the tribunal and it is not illegal to do so. <br>
                <br>In contrast to the Philippine President’s claim, the International Criminal Court (ICC) did not abuse their authority in the implementation of their full-blown investigation on his war on drugs. They replied that this case will involve facts that happened before the country withdrew from the organization, starting from November 2011. Accordingly, Duterte’s insistence on running for vice president to gain legal immunity was refuted as he recently proclaimed his resignation to politics. If he is as guilty as the ICC says, his prosecution will finally silence the cries of the victims of his reign, regaining human rights infringed by his word. <br>
                <br>With or without power, President Rodrigo Duterte must remain cooperative in proving that he is not guilty in the midst of his term’s extrajudicial killings. The second he is replaced as the highest authority in the country, no legal implications and hasty words will make him escape the fate of being the catalyst of countless Filipinos killed from his method on the Philippines’ war on drugs. Duterte should focus on fighting the cases against him head-on without heading to the hills. In times where his words become power, President Duterte must make sure that the responsibility coming with it is in accordance with his actions, even as a private citizen in his beloved country. <br>

                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em> Immunity of Arturo Lascañas (a practice article for Division Schools Press Conference 2022)</em></p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>With his past as Rodrigo Duterte’s Davao Death Squad (DDS) hitman and accessory to its crimes, Arturo Lascañas is both a witness and a criminal; that being said, the International Criminal Court’s decision to grant him limited immunity for his self-inflicting confessions is justice in its own way.<br>
                <br>Revealing the truth after years of cover-ups and evasion is hard enough but securing a confession can make or break a case, even if it comes from the mouth of the bad guy himself. As an individual, Arturo Lascañas can be suspected with untold criminal cases and involvement with the Davao Death Squad. He declared that this group followed kill orders from Rodrigo Duterte, former Mayor of Davao City and current President of the Philippines. In spite of how this confession affects the case, Lascañas’ accusations does not mean that he is exempted from the crimes he committed himself. The limited immunity given to him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prevents him from self-incriminating himself but, as International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) senior expert Ruben Carranza said, Arturo Lascañas’ immunity is only for the prosecution for the ICC’s investigation of Duterte’s drug war and the alleged DDS.<br>
                <br>Without the limited immunity deal between ICC’s Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) and him, Lascañas’ words could be lost forever, especially when his life is as dangerous as the circumstances he confessed to. The possibility of him being prosecuted by his country housing the squad he betrayed heightens. With Senate investigations terminated by his want to testify, the only option Arturo Lascañas has is to protect himself through the international court. According to ICTJ lawyer Carranza, Lascañas’ words are the key in determining the decision on who will be charged for these crimes and finally solving the cases involving Duterte and his Davao Death Squad. All Filipinos need to know the truth behind this intricate web of accusations so the country should also cut this whistleblower some slack and proceed to protect him until justice reigns all. <br>
                <br>As a former assassin and a vital witness, Arturo Lascañas’ limited immunity from his confession is the best way to bring justice to Filipino lives affected by Duterte's drug war and the Davao Death Squad’s presence. The Philippines must also help this man shed light to the words he spoke of and cooperate with the International Criminal Court. Everyone deserves to know what really happened in these past few years, and with the witness-assin Arturo Lascañas’ protection, the truth may prevail after all. <br>

                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em> Approval of House Bill No. 7814 (a practice article for Division Schools Press Conference 2022)</em></p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>When mere speculations can convict countless Filipinos accused of illegal drug crimes, the approval of House Bill No. 7814 drives fear into the hearts of the innocent, replacing their trust with dread as they fear assumptions that can sentence them as guilty— even if they are innocent.<br>
                <br>As a fiercer way to implement the Republic Act No. 9165, also known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, HB 7814 gives more power to law enforcement agents. A provision states how a person is first presumed to be guilty with drug-related crimes, may it be abetting an escape or possessing importation receipts, before he could prove it otherwise. When this bill becomes law, the usual ‘innocent until proven guilty’ will be reversed when it comes to accusations involving illegal drugs. As understood by Jesus Suntay, House committee on human rights chair, his vote in favor of HB 7814  will be convicting the accused through speculations, which is an act he does not approve of. Proper investigations on drug-related suspects could be overlooked and hasty assumptions might prevail. Those who are framed for their involvement could have their lives stuck on imprisonment when they are actually blameless.<br>
                <br>	In another perspective, the terror House Bill No. 7814 brings is effective against sought-after drug personalities who remained unscathed because of the tame nature of RA 9165. According to Robert Ace Barbers, House committee on dangerous drugs chair, law enforcers armed with legal presumptions will have the chance to put the evasive accused over the same pedestal as the suspected drug criminals. Regardless, everyone will be overpowered by this bill when the time comes. When the line between ifs and innocence becomes blurry because of HB 7814, must the country wait for spilled blood before realizing that turning this bill into law is as bad as it gets?<br>
                <br>	The harsh nature of a law might be present but at the end of the day, it is still the law. Unfortunately, time is running out before House Bill No. 7814 amends RA 9165, making those involved with drugs guilty before they are innocent. When hasty conclusions are at bay, Philippine prisons could be filled with scapegoats and framed individuals. With this questionable bill, who knows how many civilian lives could be jeopardized in the hands of law. <br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>Smiling faces turn into frowns as typhoon-affected Filipinos claim: how long should they be resilient when disasters come? Sure enough, the famed bayanihan can help them live for so but after all this time, the government should be embarrassed about their inaction towards their suffering subjects. Nobody is at fault for the harsh typhoons that wrecked homes and livelihoods but the aftermath must be handled by those with power. These disasters fuel distrust among the public to their leader more than the independence they are expected of.<br>
                <br>As Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte lamented that the budget is “immensely depleted,” he still promised a Php 10 billion allocation. While Filipinos drown and despair, he spoke of an amount that may or may not reach the affected in time. The implications of his words are endless; is he saying that bayanihan must help first before the government’s response? Duterte is basically giving the lives of his people into their own hands. He could have thought of something different to make sure that Filipinos could have had their lives easier. His inaction is distressing; it should be easier for him to express his compassion as having the highest position of power. <br>
                <br>The self-reliance of Filipinos may be a good thing but after everything that has happened, what if this empathy wanes? It may be the citizens’ responsibility to look after each other but with the government who possesses the most resources and the highest authority, it must make enough laws to fuel hope for tomorrow even after disasters. In all of the years the Philippines stood against its fight against the weather, the President must focus on regaining the public’s trust through relief operations and sustainable solutions. If he is willing to take action, countless organizations are willing to pair up with him. Bayanihan involves everyone, and with more power, the greater amount of help is given to the affected.<br>
                <br>When disasters end, distrust soon arrives. How this country’s politicians become indifferent to its citizens does not show an inkling on what a public-serving government should be. With everybody familiar with the progressing disasters that arrive, the President and other governmental organizations should have plans regarding the safety of the society. When lives are being lost and expectance becomes acceptance, will power even matter for the people?<br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;
                <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                <br>Like that obstinate friend dragging us to that God-forsaken roller-coaster ride, Ferdinand “Bong Bong” Marcos, Jr. is leading the country through plastic promises of unity and reformation; meanwhile, the road ahead of us remains unmapped.<br>
                <br>We are all familiar with how political campaigning works: catchy jingles, candidate-defining colors, and soundbites presenting their agenda for the next few years. Accordingly, every presidential candidate has their own method of winning our hearts but their actions all answer one question: If elected as the President of the Philippines, what can you do for the Filipinos? Bong Bong Marcos answers, guess what? Unity! As stated in an article from Rappler, his Uniteam (with running mate Sara Duterte) said cooperation is the key for this “new society” he’s planning to lead us into. He’s campaigning for change when in reality, this Junior is using the dead dictator’s legacy to claim more votes! All the media knows about him is how he stubbornly revives the compromised image of Ferdinand Marcos, Sr.. If he sits in the highest position of the country, will he conjure the ghost of his father to seek advice? Marcos, Jr. is not his father; he neither has his achievements nor his eloquence. Why should the public vote for a child borrowing the face of his father?
                <br>
                <br>Yes, he is not Marcos, Sr. but at the same time, he is. Bong Bong can just make the Philippines better, like the first half of his father’s reign, and prevent the oppressive Martial Law from happening again. Easy, right? No! In comparison to his Uniteam, other presidential candidates have more detailed plans expressed through televised debates and clear-as-day campaigns. His vague agenda leads the country into a world of unknown and with our worsening state, how does he plan to drag us away from hell with only “unity” in mind?<br>
                <br>Rome wasn’t built in a day, and surely, their plans to build it weren’t just a big unity word scribbled across a page. Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. should try elaborating what his campaign is all about. Is it a farce to fool Filipinos that we’re looking at his impressive but oppressive father? Is the entirety of his plan focused on winning the hearts of everyone while the country’s economy falls? Will his win give us a breath of fresh air and think, this son is finally paying for his father’s sins?<br>
                <br>In the 2022 Presidential elections, Bong Bong Marcos may carry the image of his father but no matter how related they are, he will not be as good as him. Junior’s credentials, tact, and presence is a shadow to what Marcos supporters expect him to be. This roller-coaster ride is not what the Philippines currently needs. Inside a dark cave with BBM claiming light, the public must not trust him because we know he cannot make one.<br>

                <br>Equipped with a 100% vaccination shield, are students’ lives worth enough for their pursuit of education?
                <br>
                In a sea of various learning methods, we are all adrift with sails damaged by the limits
                given by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sailors like us are eyeing the port to better education: how can
                we strive for more knowledge if we do not know what method suits us best? Of course, the
                government’s plan to supply us with tablets, SIM cards and second-hand laptops made it easier
                for us students to access knowledge stopped by distance. With the usual face-to-face classes
                prohibited, social interaction is limited and lingering questions remained unaddressed.
                However, these possibilities were ignored by Bulacan who stubbornly resumed classes
                even when the Philippines’ current state does not prove the pandemic’s end.<br>
                <br>
                As soon as we welcomed January 2022 with fireworks, COVID-19 cases also reached the
                skies. When both students and teachers, even in the midst of their homes, were plagued by the
                disease, the Department of Education announced a sudden, academic break. Around this
                moment, fully-vaccinated Bulakenyos were already nearing 97% of the eligible population.
                According to an article by Inquirer, the province was not exempted from this spike in cases, which
                reached 393 active cases as of January 2. Are we underestimating COVID-19 for the sake of us
                being vaccinated? Being inoculated with the vaccine does not mean that everyone is literally
                invincible against the said virus. Yes, the severity of the disease is lessened. Most vaccination
                efficacies are above 90% but are we willing to sacrifice others, especially students, whose lives
                are hanging on this percentage? When education remains accessible in the safety of their homes,
                why would they need to go further and get out of their safe zone? <br>
                <br>
                All of us long for the day we could all rip the masks off our faces and laugh with our
                classmates and teachers like how we were before the pandemic happened. This hope is not
                meant to be tainted with a hasty implementation of a face-to-face class just because everyone is
                already protected. Easing restrictions comes with higher risks in contracting the disease.
                Everyone must wait; there will come a time when this pandemic will turn endemic.<br>
                <br>
                As we try to adapt and survive against the unpredictable, we should never forget that the
                virus is also trying to live with us as its enemies. With the rise of several distance learning
                methods, the changes we are used to will soon be the usual. When our invisible adversary hits
                us where it hurts the most, who knows what will happen if we remain blinded on the failure face-
                to-face classes might bring.<br>

              <br>Normalcy defined our world; well, not until the COVID-19 happened. Three years after, our nation is still stuck within its comfort zone, believing that the reopening of our economy meant coronavirus resurgence. However, everyone already has the scar symbolizing these changes that we are now used to. With both knowledge and bravery, we are more than prepared to face the new normal.
  <br> <br>
	Starting with Metro Manila, the government should start downgrading the alert levels assigned to each province when they fulfill certain conditions. Like what a Rappler article concluded, the average daily attack rate and the reproduction number of the virus of the region already fulfilled the World Health Organization’s standards: a country with less than 5% positivity rate can start reopening its economy. As survivors of the pandemic, we are used to the virus preventive measures and the corresponding inoculation process. With our knowledge as shield and the COVID-19 vaccine as our spear, what are we afraid of?<br> <br>
	Still, the lingering anxieties of our mind are shouting: the COVID-19 pandemic has not turned into an endemic; therefore, it is better to retreat than advance against our invisible enemy. What is there to fear when everybody knows how to keep themselves safe from the virus? For the past three years, we have been bombarded with information on what to do and how to survive against the disease. With this knowledge, we are already facing our fear of dying! How we have studied the coronavirus and vaccinated ourself against it are indications that we are embracing how this change could affect our future. Why must we stop at that?<br> <br>
When adversity comes, bravery must prevail before cowardice. With our modern technologies and intelligent data analysts, the Philippines is more than prepared to welcome the new society defined by the COVID-19 pandemic. Living in the new normal is not an easy task, per se, since both the rewards and the risks are too high. Accordingly, our government already anticipated and calculated what choices must be chosen. Don’t forget, the ABCs of new normal are as easy as it gets! <br>

                            <br>In prolonging the war between Ukraine, Russia is indirectly killing itself, starting from essential diplomatic roles up to the lives of the very citizens that it treasures. <br>
                            <br>
With a military multinational alliance recruiting countries all around its border, Russia opted to act on its anxiety and greed: it claimed that NATO’s expansion through Ukraine is unacceptable and distressed that Ukrainians are the ones acting against them, which they determined to be a plausible reason for war. As stated by the ABS-CBN News Channel, Russia’s invasion is centered around Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, and with its end unforeseen, the war will be more harmful to their forces than beneficial. Using dirty tactics such as misinformation and propaganda will not make their situation better than ever.<br>
<br>
While Russia pushes through Ukraine’s defense, direct consequences hit the rest of its stubbornness to win the war. As stated by Richard Mills, United States deputy ambassador to UN, 12 Russian diplomats were expelled since they were taking part in activities not related to their current position that concerned their national security. Even the neutral Switzerland joins the EU-imposed sanctions to Russia. Major corporations like Shell, Aercap, Microsoft and Disney terminated some of their business involvements with the country. Leading sports coordinators agreed in banning Russian athletes in international events. As the Russian Ruble fell, the country’s decision to increase their interest rate to 20% troubled its citizens in doing so. These disadvantages are not worth it for their pursuit of power!<br>
<br>
While Russia faced indirect attacks coming from everywhere, Ukraine grasped on the receiving end of the world’s affection. Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. reached out to the ministers of the neighboring countries of Ukraine to receive Filipinos evacuating from Ukraine, even if they have no visa. The generosity of foreign individuals all around the world are helping the Ukrainians flee the bloodbath coming from their home country. What is Russia aiming for with all of the lives spilled from their greed?<br>
<br>
Russia’s choice to go to war is a decision that they will no longer have the chance to reverse. Ukraine’s measures to save itself and the world’s response on their plight is deserving on what it seems to be a prideful invasion. When the end is not in sight, Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine has bitten them back. It is up to them if they should let go or further fall back into the trap they have set for themselves.
