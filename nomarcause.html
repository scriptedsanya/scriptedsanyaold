                <br>	The Philippines is on the verge of jeopardy! With a prominent senator, former boxer, dedicated public servant, and traditional politician, there is one whose actions would definitely take this distressed country into a roller-coaster ride. In a vote-focused, soundbite-infested campaign, former senator Ferdinand “Bong Bong” Marcos, Jr. plays with the public through the guess-his-agenda game. As a son of the late dictator, his likeness to his father must not be taken lightly. Will Bong Bong restore the country’s economy or plunge it deeper into the depths of debt? <br>
                <br>Every presidential candidate has their own method of winning the hearts of the public but their actions answer one question: If elected as the President of the Philippines, what can you do for the Filipinos? Without the existence of Bong Bong Marcos’ clear agenda, the future of the country is questionable. All the media knows about him is how he stubbornly revives the compromised image of Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. which is worrying. If he sits in the highest position of the country, he will not solve his problems based on what his father had done. Marcos, Jr. is not Marcos, Sr.; he neither has his achievements nor his eloquence. Why should the public vote for a child borrowing the face of his father?<br>
                <br>	Accordingly, some of BBM’s supporters stand with this reply: Yes, he is not Marcos, Sr. but at the same time, he is. Bong Bong can just make the Philippines better, like the first half of his father’s reign, and prevent the oppressive Martial Law from happening again. Is it that easy? No! An article from Rappler reiterated that Marcos’ campaign promised better infrastructure… and that’s it. Other presidential candidates also have this development with other issues that they would like to address. With his competitors’ clear plans for the future, BBM’s vague agenda seems like he is leading the country and the Filipinos into oblivion.<br>
                <br>In the 2022 Presidential elections, Bong Bong Marcos may carry the image of his father but no matter how related they are, he will not be as good as him. Junior’s credentials, tact, and presence is a shadow to what Marcos supporters expect him to be. This roller-coaster ride is not what the Philippines currently needs. Inside a dark cave with BBM claiming light, how can the public trust him when they know he cannot make one? <br>

                <br>	Like a playboy spewing kilig nonsense to the girl he’s targeting, Ferdinand “Bong Bong” Marcos, Jr. is serenading the country with plastic promises. <br>
                <br>We are all familiar with how political campaigning works: catchy jingles, candidate-defining colors, and soundbites presenting their agenda for the next few years. Sure, Bong Bong Marcos has it all but unlike his fellow candidates, we have no idea how he’ll lead us. In accordance with Rappler’s article, the Uniteam, Marcos, Jr. and his running mate, Sara Duterte, proclaims of reuniting the country through unity while appeals to the kind nature of the Filipinos. They speak of the ways they could do, like improve the tourism sector, create infrastructures, and make the internet connection faster, but all of these are all dreams if they won’t even tell us how they plan to achieve it. If Marcos, Jr. expects himself to lead the country by May 2022, he must show us the directions to success.  <br>
