                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"> Press and Proclamations: Who's More Threatened by Self-Expression?</p>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://www.rappler.com/moveph/with-anti-terror-law-red-tagged-campus-press-struggle-report-coronavirus-pandemic">Red-tagging: a threat to press freedom and democracy</a></em></p>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: left;"
                            <br>Mediums of communication, may it be the air, a text message, or a Tweet flung across the Internet for the world to see, are readily available and easily obtainable by average Filipinos, but that doesn't mean that they're ready to go all out and shout, "I hate my neighbor's noisy dog; I wish he would just die," right? <br>
                            <br> The 1987 Constitution, Article III, Section 4 announces that "no law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or the press..." Since the law recognizes everyone, whether you, your friends, the creepy guy at the terminal, or the terrorists living here, it's pretty evident that it implies how we can deliver ourselves effortlessly since nothing cannot stop us from prohibiting it.<br>
                            <br> Of course, a criticized example of this situation is the sinister Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020. Neri Colmenares, Human Rights Lawyer, speaks on how this proclamation threatens the freedom of expression since it indicates how it could punish people who instigate others in executing terrorism "by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, emblems, banners or other representations tending to the same end." Contradictingly, a study led by Martin Obschonka, an associate professor at the Queensland University of Technology, discovered how people's characteristics could be formulated through digital self-expression, specifically, Tweets, where vulnerabilities can be scientifically observed. Even actions like stalking our crush on Facebook to discover that he likes challenges and hating dictators make us guilty of judging their lives based on software.<br>
                            <br> Behind a screen, there's no telling if a person is capable of anything. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 does not also include how investigating social media activities are seen as violations of human rights. It presents a conclusion that the Federal Bureau of Investigation can legally snoop in and out of our accounts and subjecting public posts to the possibility that it can be a threat to national security. Since there's no need to indicate opinions that may put your reputation at risk, what is there to fear? Having proclamations that prohibit the freedom of expression, particularly the Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020, save us from the dangers of too much freedom granted to us. If we can stop verbally abusing others for their sake, why don't we establish it digitally? This controversial law is proven to make the country a better place. Poland, for example, flexes the same condition as the Philippines. As stated by the International Center for Counter-Terrorism, its National Threat Level is at 0% since the establishment of its Anti-Terrorism Law compared to the Philippines' Global Terrorism Index, which also declined after President Duterte signed the said bill.
                            <br>
                            <br> These limits imposed on the freedom of expression are also applied to campus journalists who write their way to push their liberty. What is there to fight against if the Anti-Terrorism Law of 2020 protects ourselves from the temptations of too much freedom? Comparing it to the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, strict quarantines can be considered violations of our civil liberties; why people follow it is evident since it
                            presents a physical limitation. <br>
                            <br> Complementarily, a statement by Charles Friend in The Harvard Gazette brandishes how "the
                            liberties of getting where you want to go are less concerning than the potential for disinformation and
                            rumor-mongering." After all, even the United States of America includes laws that recognize the
                            limitations of freedom of speech if it inflicts damage to the other party involved. <br>
                            <br> The Ericsson Mobility Report reveals that in 2021, smartphone users in the Philippines will hit 90
                            million; that's the same amount of people who have a right to express their disagreement, dangerous
                            views, possible threats, and troublesome plans about the government. We might be wondering, "Does
                            everything I say defines who I am today?" According to the Anti-Terror Law of 2020, it's a "Yes!" <br>

                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em> Based on a webinar conducted by the High School Philippine History Movement [1/3] </em></p>

                            <br>Sudden changes in the Department of Education’s curriculum pursued the removal of Philippine History, leaving the masses with an impaired ability to determine the differences between the South China Sea and the West Philippine Sea. This controversial territorial dispute gained the popularity it instilled in social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Since fake news circulated the Internet, and these alterations can twist the public, the issues regarding to ditching the historical background of the Philippines as a high school subject remained up for debate. Does the lack of knowledge about the Philippine History, especially when it comes to territories, affect the public’s understanding of the differences between the rightful name of the sea? Absolutely, yes!<br>
                            <br> Fake news has circulated the Internet; most prominent alterations observed in popular social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. With a lack of background knowledge, most Filipinos may interchangeably use South China Sea or the West Philippine Sea as a name pertaining to a single body of water. Even the Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo was recently confused about the disparities between China’s self-proclaimed territory and the Philippines’ zone. After the ABS-CBN News Channel reported this complication on YouTube, hundreds of comments ranted on how lies were being fed by the same government they voted on. Our freedom of information, even though it is still accessible, became shrouded by the order the Department of Education imposed. How important is Philippine History among elementary pupils when high school students like us can actually have the ability to change the world?<br>
                            <br>We must fear how the fast-paced millennium will soon turn truth to rumors. The critical thinking we can pursue through the implementation of Philippine History in the high school curriculum will change every perspective for the better. In accordance with what High School Philippine History Movement President Jamaico D. Ignacio stated, social media encourages historical distortions and historical revisionism. Our history became vulnerable to change! What would this incident lead to? False information, manipulated facts, and changed perceptions will change the Philippines in unpredictable ways.<br>
                            <br>The fiasco between the rightful name of the sea between the Philippines’ and China’s may start to worsen, especially when the Filipinos themselves remained confused on how to identify their territories versus the Chinese. As stated by the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea professor Jay Batongbacal in an ABS-CBN report, an international tribunal finalized the Philippines’ rule of the West Philippine Sea, as opposed to the fake news circulating that our nation has no right over the said territory. If this fabrication from the Internet continued to manipulate the minds of the Filipinos, we might have gone against a government who may be doing the best they can for our sake.
                            <br>
                            <br>Lies, lies, lies. Everything may be a lie, but if published Philippine History lecture books state otherwise, we will have a chance to prey on what is right. <br>

                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"> The Past Creates Your Identity: Prioritize It!</p>
                            <p style="font-family: 'Overpass Mono', monospace;text-align: center;"><em>Based on a webinar conducted by the High School Philippine History Movement [2/3]</em></p>

                            <br>A democratic government like the Philippines stands high and mighty because of the people that voted in favor of its excellence and integrity, but if individuality became compromised caused by one’s lack of insight of the past, Generations X and Alpha may transform for the worst.<br>
                            <br>The significance of individuality came from the High School Philippine History Movement’s stance to bring back Philippine History as a high school subject that strengthens critical thinking, in contradiction to the memorization-based technique. If this trait is overlooked, the Department of Labor and Employment will encounter thousands of college graduates who lack the essential competencies. The inadequacy of lessons on the Philippine History risks this possibility, but this will not be the end of the crisis.<br>
                            <br> In critical thinking, objectivity in analysis of an argument prevails. We can also gain this skill from other subjects, such as Mathematics, English, and Science, but History instigates the growth of loyalty to one’s nation. A study published also determined how self-identity and nationalism bonds, so did the Department of Health need to remove the Philippines’ past as a high school subject when it serves as the beacon that uncovers who we are? No way!<br>
                            <br>The drop of critical thinkers prevails in our generation, which similarly alters the next millennium. Logical reasoning and evaluation continue to fail our expectations to the children left to reinvigorate the world. Social issues, specially poverty and homelessness, can be addressed properly if students gain continuous lessons that encourage critical thinking, which boost their self-identity. Have you encountered a fellow Filipino delighted with his individuality and embracing his nationalism? What would our majestic nation be like if Filipinos know more about their past and become critical thinkers that understand issues through a well-meaning self-identity?
                            <br>
                            <br> The Filipinos’ individuality connects with the Philippine democracy, and critical thinking manipulates the state of knowing oneself. The crisis highlighting the lack of this skill influences one’s self-identity that disrupts significant aspects in one’s life. Studying Philippine History as a high school student will dramatically improve their well-being, as opposed to memorization proven to heighten their stress levels. An hour of history, with open-ended questions about forgotten controversies, is better than mathematical jargons that everyone needs to learn by heart even though more of them long to be a journalist.<br>
                            <br>As the saying goes, the past predicts the present, which affects the future. Will you choose to forget the Philippines’ previous experiences or encourage its reinstatement for every Filipino who longs to be critical thinkers that would fight for what is true? <br>
                            <br>Prioritize the past! Let it refine you! <br>
