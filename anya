I am crying
F Bb
and begging for a love
A7
gone bad

Dm
so it seems like
F
I'm just a fool for you
Dm
and they say that
F A7
you can't just be somebody to me

Pre-chorus:
F
before eleventh hour chimes
Dm
don't you dare say that
F
I'm the one who cheered you back
Bb A7
while you said those lies

I am crying
and begging for a love
gone mad

Verse:
She could hear you
The rumors drowning her
Whisper softly
please, end up with me

Pre-chorus:
sing those songs of happy
a perfect family
hold your tongue; it's deadly
she's sleeping soundly

Chorus:
I am crying
and begging for a love
gone bad


There’s something within me that wants to escape this so-called cage called reality.
Hi. I’m Sanya. The youngest daughter of a perfectly normal family. As a student, I had countless achievements but everything lies between what’s average and what’s expected of me.
I don’t know if my parents know but I really do feel like I don’t belong here. No, you stand corrected. It’s not like there’s something wrong with them. It’s not like there’s something wrong with my role as an upstanding citizen. It’s not like I grew up to be something of an awful human being.
I’m just me. Why does it fucking hurts, though?
I’m currently in the middle of class. My stomach’s filled with snacks and I don’t really wanna eat breakfast. In every minute I spend with my classmates, I become as incompetent as the one I’m afraid to become. I feel my delusions crumbling. I don’t want this reality. I don’t want this life.
I used to go to church every Sunday. I used to stop being mindful on how everything works. I used to think that I’m just a Sanya among all of the Katherines, Gwyns, Camilles, and Andrews that surround me. I know I will never be a Fergielynne nor a Dharen. It’s not my nature to be a Cherady. I’m not even who I dream to be. What the fuck is happening?
I think my mind’s filled with countless worlds I’ve read. Most of the time, I see myself looking past the windows of the fourth wall, preying on each character’s emotion, wondering about what love feels like. Sometimes, I feel like I’m disconnected from the world yet by trying to connect with it means hurting myself in the most unimaginable way possible. It hurts to be human. Why is it so?
Did God create me with this pain in mind?
I don’t have anything to do with life. Should I pursue something that is expected of me? I feel like I’m lost in the train tracks. Should I jump between the rails and see what death takes me? I’m falling in love with the idea that there’s something wrong with anything and everything that makes up this so-called reality. The humans will beg to differ, though, so I think I’m not even one.
I feel like a conscious being stuck in a Sanya. She’s basically something out of a typical world but when did I have the time to compare my life with the fantasies drawn out in intricate sketches and mind-boggling worlds?
If I rip out this so-called body of mine, will I be able to escape their grasp?
There’s this feeling inside me that says how I wished to be a woman since my spirit speaks as if I was a gay guy. I think God granted that promise. Thank you for that.
There’s this urge inside of me to let myself be killed by the ones who hate me. Can you get me a yandere? There’s something beautiful about dying by the hands of the one who loves you the most.
If I break this mirror in front of me, will the dimension past that shatter into pieces? Will her reality cease to exist? Am I even that powerful to destroy a world somebody is living in?
I think I’m psychopathic. Thank God I learned respect.
There are certain people who deserve to die, after all.
